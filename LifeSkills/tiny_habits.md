# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits Reflection

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg 
### Question 1 - **Most interesting story or idea:**  
BJ Fogg’s story about helping his friend build the habit of flossing just one tooth was eye-opening. It showed how starting tiny removes resistance. The idea that “emotion creates habit, not repetition” was powerful—especially for someone building both technical and creative routines. It’s not about willpower; it’s about designing success.

### Question 2 - **Using B = MAP to build habits:**  
- **B = Behavior** happens when  
- **M = Motivation**,  
- **A = Ability**, and  
- **P = Prompt** converge.  
To make habits easier:
- Reduce effort (increase Ability)  
- Attach the habit to an existing routine (create a Prompt)  
- Don’t rely on high Motivation—design for low-effort success

### Question 3  - **Why celebrate ("Shine") after a habit?**  
Celebration wires the habit into your brain emotionally. It creates a positive association, making you want to repeat it. Even a fist pump or saying “Yes!” can trigger dopamine. For branding tasks or coding breakthroughs, this emotional reinforcement helps you stay consistent and energized.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day 
### Question 4 - **Most interesting story or idea:**  
The idea that small improvements compound over time—just 1% better each day—was deeply motivating. The story of the British cycling team transforming through marginal gains showed how tiny tweaks in sleep, nutrition, and gear led to Olympic dominance. It’s a reminder that daily design edits, code refactors, or video tweaks are building something massive.

### Question 5  - **Perspective on Identity:**  
Habits shape identity. Instead of saying “I want to run,” say “I’m a runner.” Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. Every flyer you design or Java module you build reinforces your identity as a premium brand builder and resilient developer.

### Question 6 - **Making a habit easier to do:**  
- Reduce friction  
- Use the 2-minute rule: make the habit so small it takes less than 2 minutes  
- Prepare your environment (e.g., keep design assets organized or have your IDE ready)  
This aligns with modular coding and visual workflows—make the first step effortless.

### Question 7 - **Making a habit harder to do:**  
- Increase friction  
- Remove cues  
- Make the action inconvenient  
For example, to reduce phone distractions, log out of social media or keep your phone in another room while editing videos.
