## Question 4: What are the dangers of social media, in brief?
Social media can seriously drain your focus and make it really tough to concentrate deeply on important tasks. It constantly pulls your attention away, encouraging short bursts of distraction instead of sustained thinking. This often leads to procrastination, where you waste time scrolling through irrelevant content. On top of that, social media can increase feelings of stress and anxiety because of constant comparison and information overload. Overall, it fragments your time and breaks up your attention, which hurts both your productivity and creativity.
